Rechargeable battery advisory tool

I've got a "smart recharger" [Powerex MAHA (MH-C9000 WizardOne)](https://mahaenergy.com/mh-c9000/).
And at some day I realized that I want to place my batteries with closed capacity.
Because the total capacity of rechargeables is equal to the least capacity in batch.

So is the idea.
